      <h3> Accessibilty and cloud computing </h3>
      <p align="left">
      <br>Cloud computing provides organizations with the flexibility 
      <br>and commodity of computing resources on demand. There are many 
      <br>cloud computing providers, one of the big market leaders is 
      <br>Amazon Web Services; they lead the market due to their innovative 
      <br>and easy to use services. Accessibility is important in this field because, 
      <br>in pricing models such as Software-as-a-Service, users will be interacting 
      <br>with services that they must fully understand in order to use the SaaS<abbr title="Software-as-a-Service">SaaS</abbr>
      <br>appropriately. Software-as-a-Service is one of the most common forms of cloud computing, 
      <br>major examples of SaaS as Google Gmail, Dropbox, and Microsoft Office 365. 
      <br>Accessibility ensures that customers are able to use the software without any problems. 
      <br>This is why I am very excited to learn techniques, guides, and knowledge 
      <br>of what it is that makes a user feel good when interacting with cloud technologies.
