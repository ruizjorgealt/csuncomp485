      <h3> Accessibilty and cloud computing </h3>
      <p align="left">
      Cloud computing provides organizations with the flexibility 
      and commodity of computing resources on demand. There are many 
      cloud computing providers, one of the big market leaders is 
      Amazon Web Services; they lead the market due to their innovative 
      and easy to use services. Accessibility is important in this field because, 
      in pricing models such as Software-as-a-Service, users will be interacting 
      with services that they must fully understand in order to use the SaaS<abbr title="Software-as-a-Service">SaaS</abbr>
      appropriately. Software-as-a-Service is one of the most common forms of cloud computing, 
      major examples of SaaS as Google Gmail, Dropbox, and Microsoft Office 365. 
      Accessibility ensures that customers are able to use the software without any problems. 
      This is why I am very excited to learn techniques, guides, and knowledge 
      of what it is that makes a user feel good when interacting with cloud technologies.
