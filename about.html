        I am persistent when I want to learn a new topic that interests me. 
        If it appears difficult or complex at the beginning, I will analyze and make a plan on how I am going to approach this topic so that I can learn the most without working hard. 
        Organization and planning are very important to me, I believe that when we work in an organized manner, we excel because that demonstrate that we care about whatever it is that we wish to accomplish. 
        This is why I believe that organization is important when researching a topic that I like. Organization is key for me to succeed in all of my classes, it allows me to focus on the important information, complete all my tasks on time, and perform well. 
        This technique allows me to design and write clear, concise, concrete, and comprehensive notes that are pleasing to the eye. However, the best part is to be able and share my notes with my peers if they are struggling in a class; I like to help others in need.

        I am enthusiastic when I have to work with other individuals. 
        I find it rather interesting and exciting that I will be given the opportunity to talk and discuss my ideas with people from different backgrounds. 
        Diversity is something I appreciate because I believe that when you bring individuals from different backgrounds together, you end up with a better answer to an existing problem. 
        Everyone's different point of view and way of thinking give a broader and better perspective when it comes to problem-solving.

        I am a senior Information Systems/ Information Technology student at California State University, Northridge and I am active in many organizations where I am given the opportunity to help other individuals. 
        I am currently the Director of Technology for MISA (Management Information Systems Association) and I enjoy every minute of my role knowing that I will make a positive impact on the members by exposing them to new opportunities. 
        I love being resourceful to students in need of guidance and inspiration, my participation allows me to provide information and opportunities that lead students to success. 
        One of my greatest successes at MISA was the opportunity to implement a tasks management system that allowed members to complete their tasks in a nice and aesthetically pleasing web application. 
        This new approach allowed my organization to increase our productivity and participation.

        My main objective is to learn as much as I can to  grasp a better understanding on user experience. 
        Unfortunately, at the moment I consider my self an individual that is ignorant in this topic. 
        I am very excited to learn techniques, guides, and knowledge of what it is that makes a user feel good when interacting with software.
